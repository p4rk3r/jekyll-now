After a crazy night in the "Lab" experimenting with liquid nitrogen and all sorts of alcoholic flavours (more on that later), this is my first entry on a weekly summary of the most shocking advances in AI I had the chance to look at (not sure if I should change to daily, as almost every day there is a new publication that blows my mind away). Below my favorites for the week

## The upcoming lip-reading module for "Skynet" - LIPNET: Sentence-level lipreading - ([PDF](http://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkjLkSqxg))

**Highlit from the abstract:** _LipNet is the first lipreading model to operate at sentence-level, using a single end-to-end speaker-independent deep model to simultaneously learn spatiotemporal visual features and a sequence model. On the GRID corpus, LipNet achieves 93.4% accuracy, outperforming experienced human lipreaders and the previous 79.6% state-of-the-art accuracy._

**My take:** 
- Truly impressive progress in using Deep Learning for lip reading. 
- LipNet is trained end-to-end to make speaker-independent sentence-level predictions. Look out for this to be applied in industrial spionage (Remember to cover your mouth from now on when cameras around)

## Discovering new drugs with Deep Learning 
_Ingesting a heap of drug data allows a machine-learning system to suggest alternatives humans hadnâ€™t tried yet. ([Link](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602756/software-dreams-up-new-molecules-in-quest-for-wonder-drugs/))_
**Highlits:** A new artificial intelligence aims to create new drugs by learning what molecules already work and what may fit with existing patterns.
